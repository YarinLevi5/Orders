# Orders Project

## About

In this project, I create three collections: orders, clients, and stores in MongoDB,
express server in node.js and UI of all. 
In clientsand stores there is an option to: 
 - [x] Insert
 - [x] Find by id/name 
 - [x] Find all 
 - [x] Update by id. 

In orders, there is an option to:
 - [x] Insert order by choosing client-ID and store-ID
 - [x] Update order by id
 - [x] Find all orders

## Challenge & Solution
I have thought about how can I update (order/client/store).
Finally, I did it with a **GET request**, that all the data will be visible in the inputs for the client.
Then update it with a **PUT request**. 

## Work with

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. MongoDB
5. Node.js - Express server, Controllers.
